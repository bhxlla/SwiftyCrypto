# SwiftyCrypto

This app was made by following a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwvDm4Vfkdphbc3bgy_LpLRQ9DDfFGcFu" target="_blank" >Swiftful Thinking course</a> on Youtube. <br />
It uses SwiftUI, Combine, CoreData along with MVVM Architecture.  <br />
The Project benefits from multi threading, data persistence and reactive programming.
